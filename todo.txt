Bugs:
	- (Android) WebView rendering reduces image quality and distorts 2px lines sometimes.

	- [code] and similar code layout elements breaks page layout by stretching out the page
	  until the code has all been displayed on one line. This seriously needs fixing!

	- Page background sometimes becomes distorted and will render off center or
	  even just render fragments of the Facepunch logo. This seems to have something to do
	  with scrolling, because scrolling while an off-center logo is displayed snaps
	  it back into place.

Features:
	
	- Quoting. Currently quoting "works" but it needs some more regex work to convert HTML
	  post elements to properly quotable BBCode and plain text.

	- Post editing. The "Edit" button is already in place, all that needs to be done is
	  making it open an "Edit Post" textbox and sending the updated post to the API server.

	- Ticker support

	- Private messaging
